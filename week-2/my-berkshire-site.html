	What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	* It was harder both easier and harder than expected. The first steps were easy, but it took a lot longer than I would have thought to set up links, even though they didn’t have to go anywhere. And despite all the reminders I have heard since starting, I still forgot to close my tags. Also, I wanted to get to <div> tags, but ran out of time.

	How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	* It was interesting.  It looks like there are some new tags that will make some elements easier to create. Also, good to remember that the language will always be evolving.

	How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	* I think I did okay, but I _really wanted_ to do more formatting.

	What seems good and bad about HTML?
	* I don’t think I know enough to answer well. But it’s good that there is just one language for webpages, rather than the nearly infinite number of programming languages. Text works a lot like markdown.

	What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	* The cheat sheets are helpful. The basics make sense to me, so I haven’t developed any tricks to remember yet.
