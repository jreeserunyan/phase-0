* Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

- A wireframe is a basic sketch of the content of your site.  It takes into account some design ideas, but at a really basic level. Little to no color, nothing fancy. Wireframing is about planning layout, information hierarchy and user interaction.  It’s a lot like a blueprint. 

- Wireframing gives you time to think about how your site is going to work before you start getting distracted by pretty images. Its a good place for iteration since it isn’t as time consuming as the actual design I think it’s going to really helpful here, as a reference for what I am trying to do with html.

- I loved this challenge! But I know my way around *Adobe Illustrator*, so it was easy. (And since I am trying to stay focused on learning all these new things, I haven’t been letting myself play in any design programs, it was an unexpected treat.)

- I did a few iterations because it went pretty quickly. And I wanted to give myself some tricky stuff to figure out in html.

- I had an idea what it was before getting started.
I still read over the articles provided and looked at the info about wire framing in *HTML&CSS* by Jon Duckett. 

- This was totally in my comfort zone. Though, of course, I have no idea if I can actually do any part of it with html. So that might make me look back and wish I had gone with something more simple. Though I am looking forward to perfectly successful git workflow.!
