# Add it up!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Lauren M.]. We were not able to finish it.

# 0. total Pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!

# Input: array [nums]
# Output: sum of all nums in array

# Steps to solve the problem.
# Initialize index total at 0 
# 	Take each element in the array and add them together
# return sum

# 1. total initial solution
# def total(array)
# 	total = 0
# 	array.each { |arr| total += arr }
# 	return total
# end

# 3. total refactored solution

# maybe?
# def total(array)[0]
# 	array.each { |arr| total += arr }
# end

# 4. sentence_maker pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!
# Input: array of strings
# Output: each element joined in a sentence

# Steps to solve the problem.
# define the array
# 	join the elements
# produce a sentence

# # 5. sentence_maker initial solution
def sentence_maker(array)
	array.join 
	return sentence_maker
end

# 6. sentence_maker refactored solution
