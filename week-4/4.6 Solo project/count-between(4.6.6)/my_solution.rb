# Count Between

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# Despite my best efforts, I could not get anywhere this. 
# I have some notes in here, but they don't even count as pseudocode, which I obviously need to work on. 
# I am stuck. I know I read somewhere that it's okay to give up.
# Or at least, it's better to give up than to put down an answer I don't understand.

# count_between is a method with three arguments:
#   1. An array of integers
#   2. An integer lower bound
#   3. An integer upper bound
#
# It returns the number of integers in the array between the lower and upper bounds,
# including (potentially) those bounds.
#
# If +array+ is empty the method should return 0

# Your Solution Below

def count_between(list_of_integers, lower_bound, upper_bound)
  # Your code goes here!
  list_of_integers.count { |x , y| puts count_between}
# end

# 	

# 	count_between
	returns 0
end
end




# get the list of integers

# find the range created by lower_bound and upper_bound
#	if x is < lower_bound = false
# 	if x is > lower_bound = true

# maybe i need another variable

# 	if y is < upper_bound = true
# 	if y is > upper_bound = false
# while
# y == true && x == true
# return y..x
# is list within range?
# list_of_integers.length
# 	
# check to see if each integer in the list is in that range (answer true or false)

# return all intgers that are true
