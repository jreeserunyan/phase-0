# Input:
# Output:
# Steps:
define instance method GuessingGame#guess
use guess as Input
guess should 
	if guess > answer return :high
	if guess = answer return :correct
	if guess < answer return :low

define instance method GuessingGgame#solved?
	return true if most recent guess is correct
	return false otherwise

# Initial Solution

class GuessingGame
  def initialize(answer)
    # Your initialization code goes here
  end
