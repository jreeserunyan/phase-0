		<h3>A little thing called version control</h3>
		<p>Imagine you’re doing super sophisticated work on something. Let’s say you’re painting and you want to experiment with the colors and see where it takes you. You could paint different versions of it with different colors until you’re sick of it, or, if you really like pain, you could experiment over the same canvas. Version Control is like having a tiny robot on your shoulder creating an exact version of that painting at moments of your choosing. So if you mess up, you could go back to an earlier version and, similarly, if you decide a combination of colors worked better than another, you could select that particular one and make it your “master” painting.</p>
		<p>What it means in dev talk (unmastered as of yet, but I’ll give it a try) is that as long as record a snapshot if a particular set of choices, version control will keep that for you. What’s great about that is that you don’t have to be a developer to benefit from it. Regardless of what files or projects you’re working on, version control can help you retain the ideas or milestones of your choosing as the project is progressing and you can visualize your (and your team’s) thinking process.</p>
		<p>For a developer this means using git, a version control system which you can use locally on your computer or link it to GitHub, which is a web-based sharing service for your git files. Git is pretty smart too about recording these changes. It won’t automatically record every change; instead, it will offer you a “stage” where you can send your changes to when you’re ready to commit to them. So you select your a sequence of changes and send them to the stage and give the final green light that git can commit to that change. This can stay entirely local (depending on the nature and scope of the project) or it can be pushed to GitHub and stored remotely as well. GitHub will store that change and make it available for review by other people, which is a great way to learn from other developers and bounce ideas off each other.</p>

		<h3>First Week at DBC</h3>
		<p>Here we are. First week of Dev Bootcamp over and already so much learned. Even though we’re in phase 0, which means mostly interacting remotely with each other, the enthusiasm and geekiness are contagious.</p>
		<p>My first impression after this week is that DBC is exactly what it portends to be before step through its doors: an environment where you’ll be challenged every day out of your comfort zone, but with kindness and support, and where you’re surrounded by like-minded people from whom you’re constantly learning. You’re expected to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, but ultimately it’s pretty clear from day one that you’re not here to score points or please anyone. You’re here for you. You are given the information, the guidelines, the challenges and the people to accomplish it all with, but you decide the direction and you’re in charge of your learning. So much of this comes down to attitude and mindset and the kitchen vs restaurant was a great metaphor to exemplify that.</p>
		<p>“Trust the process” is one statement that I heard many times before phase 0 and I admit that when I first saw how the learning experience is organized, my first instinct was that of mistrust. Dev Bootcamp seems too free, yet unyielding at the same time, and very demanding of your time and finances. One week into it, though, and that mistrust has evaporated. DBC is a very selective adult’s playground. There are rules, but mostly this is about trusting where you are and allowing yourself to play and grow as much as possible in a short amount of time. And I hear that’s where the magic of creating beautiful, meaningful things happens.</p>

<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
Header, footer, section and article keep coming up as great ways to divide up the content. I love seeing them because they immediately evoke a visual in my mind that makes it really easy for me to understand the organization of the html.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get displayed through the browser in the order they appear in the html, (until you start shoving them around with CSS).	

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 
Sublime is smart. I love the snippets. Just like actions in photoshop, they record a little bit of info and play it back for you when you call them. I definitely want to spend some time looking up what snippets already exist.
