####How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
- I loved Chrome's DevTools. By clicking on the little magnifying glass you can select specific elements. Then the inspector reveals info about that object so you can see what it is; what is wrapping around it and what rulesets are in place. Then you can modify and add rulesets. Awesome. I had been using it for looking at other's html, but didn't see much use for it for my own code. Actually working with showed me so much about the organization of a page.

####How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Add height and width properties. Keep the values to percents and ems so for the greatest flexibility and browser compatibility.

####What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
*Absolute positioning* is relative to the position of parent or grandparent element. (Also known as ancestor elements). Move the object by adding values to top, right, bottom and left. 
*Fixed positioning* is relative to the browser window. It stays in the same place as other things on the page move.
The default positioning method is `static`. *Static positioning* puts elements in the order the appear in the document. 
*Relative positioning* put.s an element relative to it's normal position. It's a bit like *absolute* but isn't reliant on another element. There's a bit of trick to each, I'm still on a learning curve.

####What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin is the outermost designation, it controls space around content
Inside that is the border. The border defines the outer edge of the element. Margin is the space between the element and the border.

####What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I really learned more than I thought I would doing this. Being able to modify the property values right in the browser made it really obvious what each ruleset was doing.
