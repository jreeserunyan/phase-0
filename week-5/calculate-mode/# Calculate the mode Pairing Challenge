# Calculate the mode Pairing Challenge

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Jamie]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented.



# 0. Pseudocode
# What is the input
#     Array containing numbers or strings
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
#    New array with most frequent value
#    If only one value, return array with one element
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
#    1.define method new_mode
#    2.create new hash
#    3.count element frequency
#    4.sort elements by count value
#    5.return: array of element associated with highest value


# 1. Initial Solution

def mode(array)
  array.sort_by {|i| array.count(i)}
end
array=[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4]
mode(array)


# def new_mode([array])
#   hash = Hash.new
#   {}
# end






#def mode(array)
  #array.max_by{|i| array.count(i)}
#end
