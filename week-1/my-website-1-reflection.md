## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

In order to store your work online, you need to set up a repository on GitHub. This is a remote location, so the fisrt step won't add anything to your computer. Go to github.com and click the plus sign that appears in the upper right corner by your pic. Choose create new "repository." Now you have a folder in GitHub that you can put stuff in. Now you want to make a copy of that folder on your machine.  There's all sorts of reasons to this. Maybe your internet is being wonky but you still need to make changes. Maybe you are working with of bunch of people and you want to be able to work without getting in thier way and the other way around. On the same page that shows you your new repository, scroll down a bit until you see a little box on the right side that has link for you to copy that starts with http.  If you hover over the icons near it one of them sats "Copy to clipboard" click it. In terminal, type git clone and then paste the url you copied onto the same line. Hit return and terminal will load an exact copy of the online repository right there.

- Describe what open source means.
Open source means that anyone can work on it. It can be passed around and altered without infringing on any copyrights.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source is a good idea. Sharing is key to accruing knowledge. It takes building on the work of others to ever really create change. A utopia might be over-stating it, but still, share freely is a positive thing.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses govern the level of freedom permitted to the public and give the creator a bit of protection. MIT is very permissive. GNU is also permissive, but it has a few more rules packaged in, the biggest, to me, is once GPL, always GPL. Meaning you can do what you want to it, but any project that comes off it must have a GPL license. 

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?  I am still struggling with the last few steps of the merge. I seem to be getting them in the wrong order. Or I think I am when the file disappears from my local directory. But maybe that's supposed to happen. Also there was an instruction to add and commit directories, but as far as I can tell, if the directories are empty, that isn't possible and I spent a lot of time on it.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. Nothing specific besides stackoverflow. While I went through the motions over and over again, I keep missing little things. I need more time to seek out comfirmation/dismissal of some partially formed thoughts. (I need some time to let my R-mode work things out for me.)
